# My-First-Program

```
As we write a simple code below in IDLE

>>> 1 + 1
2
>>>

THIS IS THE OUTPUT 2 WE GOT, BUT LET'S BREAKDOWN THE STEPS. FIRST PYTHON READ THAT CODE WE ENTERED, SECOND IT RETURN THE OUTPUT AND THIRD AGAIN IT IS READY FOR MORE CODE AS IT DISPLAYS AGAIN PROMPT(>>>) SIGN.
THIA IS A KIND OF A LOOP CALLED REPL WHICH STANDS FOR READ-EVALUATE PRINT-LOOP.

WE NOW USE PRINT FUNCTION. IT TAKES SOME TEXT INPUT AND THEN PLACES ON THE SCREEN.

>>>print("Hello")
Hello
>>>

```

```
COMING TO ERRORS, they are of two types: Syntax and Run-Time.

SUPPOSE WE WRITE:
print("hello world) AND THEN RUN IT;

The code won’t run!. IDLE DETECTS IT IS A SYNTAX ERROR.

AGAIN, NOW WE WRITE:
print(hello, aaditya) AND THEN RUN IT;

IDLE catches syntax errors before a program starts running, but some errors can’t be caught until a program is executed. These errors are Run-Time errors. Since names Hello and world haven’t been deﬁned anywhere, the program crashes.

```

```
2 PRACTICE QUESTIONS:

1. Write a script that IDLE won’t let you run because it has a syntax error.

print("hello my dear friend 'aaditya')

2. Write a script that only crashes your program once it is already running because it has a run-time error.


print(10 / 0)

```
